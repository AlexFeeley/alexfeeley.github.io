# Alex Feeley's Personal Website

Check it out: [alexfeeley.github.io](https://alexfeeley.github.io)

This website was made using the Bootstrap Framework with HTML and CSS. It was created over the Summer of 2019, and updated during the Summer of 2020. 

This website is not optimized to be viewed on smaller screens, and is best viewed on a desktop with Google Chrome. However, this website served as my first venture into web development. This website was originally written in such a way to avoid Javascript, which was a scary concept to me a year ago. I had just finished CS1101, Vanderbilt's introductory computer science course. Since then, I've become much more comfortable with computers. You can check out my new website to see my first venture into Javascript using React: [alexfeeley.com](https://alexfeeley.com)
