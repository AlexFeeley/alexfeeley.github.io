# Alex Feeley's Personal Website

Check it out: [alexfeeley.github.io](https://alexfeeley.github.io)

This website was made using the Bootstrap Framework with HTML and CSS. It was created during the Summer of 2019, and updated over the Summer of 2020. 

This website is not optimized to be viewed on smaller screens. This project was my first venture into web development, and included very little javascript as I learned to navigate HTML and CSS. You can check out my new website to see my first venture into Javascript using React.
